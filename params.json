{"name":"NeoXML","tagline":"fork/rewrite of dom4j","body":"# XML DOM Java library based on dom4j\r\n\r\nThis is my attempt to rewrite dom4j xml library for newer version of java (1.7 and above). \r\nI have renamed it to eliminate some licensing issues.\r\n\r\nMy intent is to keep this library simple in design and use. \r\nI am using dom4j in many my projects, but it is now too old and whithout maintentnace\r\n\r\n### Main goals:\r\n* Focus on simple traversal API based on java.util Collections framework (as in dom4j)\r\n* I have (and will) remove some parts of former dom4j that are not necessary and that only added some dependencies. I will maybe - if asked for - create some separate modules for theese parts. (Swing, Datatype, Xpp) \r\n* I have also added some new APIs that are more functional and are compatible with java 1.8 lambdas.\r\n* Improvement of visitor pattern - which is one of top features of former dom4j library\r\n\r\n### IMPORTANT!\r\nThis is early version of XTree and it is possible that I will rename package or library name before first release \r\n\r\n### Current state\r\nI am now focusing on JUnit test coverage and code clarity, JUnit tests from original dom4j library are fully functional and I am now adding tests for new classes and for missing use cases of original classes\r\n\r\nYou can download latest snapshot here: [neoxml-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar](https://github.com/noemus/neoxml/raw/master/neoxml-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
